# Lichess-Chess.com-Data-management

The goal of this project is to create a dataset with data obtained by web scraping and APIs from two different sources, clean the data and store it on a DBSM. 
In this particular case I crawled data from Lichess and Chess.com, stored it on MongoDB and analysed it with its analytics.
